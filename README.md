## Why QuickKeyJump?

On Windows, [Listary](https://www.listary.com/) is a godsend. Press `Ctrl+G` anywhere—even inside a Save dialog—and a floating panel shows your most recent folders. Tap a number key. Done. It becomes muscle memory within a day.

Then you switch to macOS.

There's nothing like it. Alfred's File Navigation requires extra steps. Raycast Quicklinks need manual setup. Default Folder X costs $40 and buries the one feature you need under a dozen you don't.

So I built QuickKeyJump. It started as a faithful Listary clone for macOS. Then it grew—because once you have a global hotkey engine, why stop at folder jumping? Window management, file manager, all at your fingertips.

## Install

Download `QuickKeyJump.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/kawabonka/QuickKeyJump/releases), mount it, and drag `QuickKeyJump.app` to `Applications`.

On first launch, grant **Accessibility** permission when prompted. Window management and quick jump require this.

make build
open Build/QuickKeyJump.app
